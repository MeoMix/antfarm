xantfarm notes

- simulate an ant hill
- three types of elements (air, dirt, sand)
- ants move up through Air, dig through dirt, and drop it as sand
	- ant behaviors can be wandering, carrying, or panic'ed
	

probabilities:
	- random dig: 3 (dig down while wandering)
	- random drop: 3 (drop while wandering)
	- random turn: 5 (turn while wandering)
	- concave below dirt dig: 100 (dig concave dirt below ground)
	- convex above drop: 100 (drop at convex corner above ground)
	- calm: 10 (calm from panic)
	- sand exclusion: 50 (hard to drop sand at sand/dirt)
	
environment:
	- compact depth: 15 (depth of sand turns to dirt)
	- dirt percent: 2/3 (amount of starting dirt)
	- checkpoint cycles: 5000
	
grid_size: sand_width (4)
ant_grids: (ant_lu0_width (12) / grid_size)

air/dirt/sand (0, 1, 2)

ant: {
	int x;
	int y;
	Behavior behavior;
	int timer;
	int phase;
}


DEFAULTS: 15 ants, 15 cycles, need a location to write checkpoint file to

Need a random number generator?

world:
	- width: root_w / grid_size
	- height: root_h / grid_size

surface: world_h * (1.0 - dirt percent)
	
	- for each point in the world, make it either air or dirt based on percent covered
	
	
	- moveants();
		- does nothing for ants with timer >0 (after ticking)
		- ant changes phase (?)
		- handle ants falling in the air by continuing to fall, or turn if not able to fall (?)
		- otherwise, process ant behavior
			- if wandering:
				- maybe dig
				- maybe turn
				- otherwise, refresh wandering and move
			- if carrying:
				- maybe drop
				- otherwise, refresh carrying and move
				
		
	- sand_fall();
	
	
ant:
	- x: random spot on the world's width
	- y: 1 (surface)
	- direction: random of the 8 directions
	- phase: 0
	- behavior: (behavior, a, wandering, )

QUESTIONS:
	- What is the difference between direction "LEFT DOWN" and direction "DOWN LEFT"
	- What is a timing factor?
